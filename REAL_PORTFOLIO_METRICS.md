# Real Portfolio Metrics Feature

## 🎯 Overview

The Portfolio Performance Analyzer now calculates **real portfolio metrics** using actual stock data from your holdings, not just theoretical inputs. When you upload a brokerage statement, the application automatically:

1. ✅ Extracts your holdings and portfolio value
2. ✅ Fetches 1-year historical data for each stock
3. ✅ Calculates portfolio-level metrics using real market data
4. ✅ Displays professional performance analysis

## 📊 Metrics Calculated

### Core Performance Metrics

All metrics are calculated using **real historical data** from Yahoo Finance:

1. **Sharpe Ratio**
   - Formula: `(Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Std Dev`
   - Uses actual 1-year returns and calculated volatility
   - Rating scale: Poor (<0), Below Average (<1), Good (<2), Very Good (<3), Exceptional (3+)

2. **Jensen's Alpha**
   - Formula: `Portfolio Return - [Risk-Free Rate + (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate) × Beta]`
   - Shows if you're beating the market after adjusting for risk
   - Positive = outperforming, Negative = underperforming

3. **Treynor Ratio**
   - Formula: `(Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Beta`
   - Measures return per unit of systematic risk
   - Best for comparing well-diversified portfolios

### Portfolio Characteristics

4. **Portfolio Return (1-Year)**
   - Weighted average of individual stock returns
   - Based on actual historical performance

5. **Portfolio Standard Deviation**
   - True volatility calculation using covariance matrix
   - Accounts for correlations between holdings
   - Shows diversification benefit

6. **Portfolio Beta**
   - Weighted average of individual stock betas
   - Measures systematic risk vs. market

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: Upload Brokerage Statement
```
Upload → Gemini AI Extracts Data → Holdings List Created
```

### Step 2: Automatic Calculation
```
Holdings → Fetch Historical Data → Calculate Returns
                                 → Calculate Std Dev
                                 → Calculate Beta
                                 → Get Market Data (S&P 500, T-Bills)
```

### Step 3: Compute Metrics
```
Portfolio Data + Market Data → Sharpe Ratio
                             → Jensen's Alpha
                             → Treynor Ratio
```

### Step 4: Display Results
```
Comprehensive Metrics Display → Color-coded ratings
                              → Performance feedback
                              → Holdings breakdown
                              → Market context
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoint
```javascript
POST /api/calculate-portfolio-metrics
Body: { 
  holdings: [{symbol, totalValue}],
  totalValue: number,
  totalCostBasis: number 
}

### Calculation Steps
1. Fetch S&P 500 (SPY) data for market return
2. Fetch T-Bill rate (^IRX) for risk-free rate
3. For each holding:
   - Fetch 1-year historical prices
   - Calculate stock return
   - Get stock beta
   - Calculate weight in portfolio
4. Build covariance matrix
5. Calculate portfolio variance/std dev
6. Compute Sharpe, Treynor, Alpha
